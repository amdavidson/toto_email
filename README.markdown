# toto_email

Not much to see yet, this will eventually be a ruby script that will check a POP3 server for emails and then convert them into the article format that toto uses. 

This (with cron) will allow users to email articles into toto. It will likely be extremely insecure for a while and will require use of an email server that does some serious spam filtering. 

Use at your own risk, unless you like viagra ads all over your blog.
